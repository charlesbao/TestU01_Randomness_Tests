# Randomness Tests

## TestU01
TestU01 is a standard test suite for testing the randomness of PRN, which can test longer random sequences and is much more stringent than NIST. The test suite is available at http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html.

## Experiments
In our randomness test, eight batteries, including *FIPS-140-2*, *PseudoDIEHARD*, *Alphabit*, *Rabbit*, *BlockAlphabit*, *SmallCrush*, *Crush*, *BigCrush*, are utilized to test the randomness of the proposed PRNG. 

We first focus on the influence of control parameter $c$ on the PRNGs for both cases of 2-D discrete neuron model, shown in **Table III**. The initial conditions are determined as $(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (0.1, 0)$ and accompanied by tiny perturbation as ambient noise. As can be observed, the PRNGs for $Case 1$ and $Case 2$ can be passed through all batteries of TestU01, according to the excellent secure performance of the chaotic signals generated by the 2-D discrete neuron model. In addition, the control parameters are fixed as $(a, b, c) = (0.6, 0.4, −3.3)$ and different factor $m$ is chosen as the initial condition parameter. Table IV presents the results of TestU01 experiments under different initial conditions, once more passing all the batteries. 

Therefore, the 2-D discrete neuron model is suitable for the application of PRNG.
